            <dt>Sphynx/Hairless Cats</dt>
            <dd>The most distinctive feature of this cat is its appearance of hairlessness.
                 The Sphynx is of medium size and body conformation with surprising weight for its size. The body feels warm and soft to the touch, with a skin texture akin to either a soft peach or a smooth nectarine. The Sphynx is sweet-tempered, lively, and amenable to handling.</dd>

            <dd>The British Shorthair is a compact, well-balanced, and powerful cat, with a short, very dense coat. They often convey an overall impression of balance and proportion in which no feature is exaggerated.</dd>
